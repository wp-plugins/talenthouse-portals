== Description ==

Use the shortcode th_portal to embed a widget linking to your Creative Invite on talenthouse.com, easily providing more exposure for your invite.

The Talenthouse Portal Engagement Widget allows users of your site access to the voting and submission tools available for your Creative Invite without requiring users to leave your website. 

= What is a Creative Invite? =
* A call to collaborate with established, widely-recognizable artists and brands, as well as fellow up-and-coming innovators - collectively known as Hosts.
* Talenthouse's Invites bypass the usual obstacles to success, enabling aspiring artists to make direct connections with fellow members and industry icons alike.
* The Hosts request submissions that demonstrate talent suitable for the collaboration they have in mind - submissions may be a sample of edited footage for a music video, or a design for a performer's concert attire.
* Creative Invites exist in two categories: Member Invites and Featured Invites.


= Why Host a Creative Invite? =

* Collaborate with a fellow artist to accomplish the creative project of your choice.  
* Draw from hundreds of thousands of creative Talenthouse members from around the world.
* Find winning submission(s) through open votes, your personal choice, or a combination of both.
* Invigorate your audiences and cultivate a new network of supporters.
* Win-Win: You get to partner with your preferred talent and every participant gains widespread exposure.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I get an Affiliate Key? =

Your contact within Talenthouse's implementation team can provide you with your affliate key. If you are not in contact with our team, you may request to join our partners by sending a quick email with a link to your website here: adam@talenthouse.com

= How do I change the portal width? =

Currently the portal size is controlled on Talenthouse's end. A 600px and 735px width is available. Contact your implementation team member to change which is associated with your affiliate key.

= Why is my portal cropped? =

Currently the portal size must be chosen during set-up. If you chose a wide portal and are selecting the "narrow" option for the th_portal short code it will simply crop at the more narrow pixel width.

= Why is my portal shifted or has too much margin? =

Currently the portal size must be chosen during set-up. If you chose a a narrow portal and are selecting the "wide" option for the th_portal short code it will simply have unused margin.

= The Talenthouse portal does not display =

There are several reasons this may happen

1. An invalid parameter was passed to the shortcode
1. The key used in the shortcode has a typo
1. The affiliate key is not active on Talenthouse's side

Solutions

1. In most cases an error message is displayed, try resolving this error.
1. Check the key against the one sent to you by your talenthouse contact
1. If the above does not work contact your Talenthouse contact
1. If all else fails send a bug report(see FAQ) to wp_dev@talenthouse.com 

= The Creative Invite shown is wrong =
